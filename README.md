# r5asm
An assembler for Wirth's RISC-5 CPU (http://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/FPGA-relatedWork/).

It's still a work-in-progress (actually built from the sources of another assembler I wrote some years ago - some remnants of this still remain).

Right now it only generates a raw text output (suitable for Verilog's $readmemh).
